# FATE: Better Edition

This is an extension meant to extend the FATE Core Fantasy Grounds Unity (Classic support isn't being considered) ruleset, which is based on the CoreRPG Ruleset. This ruleset is an opinionated set of tweaks to make playing FATE Core on FGU a bit more optimal for _in the opinion of the authors_. Thoughts for improvement are welcome, but there will be no effort made to tailor this extension for every use case.
